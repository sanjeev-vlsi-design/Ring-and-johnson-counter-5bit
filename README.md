Ring Counter
Overview
A Ring Counter is a type of shift register where the output of the last flip-flop is fed back to the input of the first flip-flop. It circulates a single '1' (or '0') through the bits in a cyclic manner.

Key Features
Operates on 5 bits.
Generates a sequence of five unique states.
Cyclic operation ensures the pattern repeats continuously.
Requires a reset mechanism to initialize the starting state.
Functional Description
At each clock pulse, the '1' shifts to the next position.
After five clock cycles, the counter returns to its initial state.
Ensures efficient use of flip-flops with minimal logic.
Applications
Control Systems: Sequence generation for specific timing operations.
State Machines: Simplifies implementation of fixed sequences.
LED Patterns: Used in LED chasers and decorative lighting.
Johnson Counter
Overview
A Johnson Counter (or Twisted Ring Counter) is a type of shift register where the complement of the last flip-flop's output is fed back to the input of the first flip-flop. It generates a unique set of states by utilizing both '1' and '0'.

Key Features
Operates on 5 bits.
Produces ten unique states (twice the number of flip-flops).
Generates symmetrical and predictable patterns.
Requires a reset mechanism to start at a defined state.
Functional Description
Complements the last bit and shifts it into the first position on every clock pulse.
After ten clock cycles, the counter returns to its initial state.
Efficiently utilizes flip-flops to generate twice the number of states compared to a ring counter.
Applications
Digital Systems: Sequencing operations in digital circuits.
Frequency Division: Acts as a divide-by-10 counter.
Signal Processing: Timing and control in clock-based systems.
